#A. The output of the above code is TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
#x=123 

#for i in x:
#    print(i)

#B.In the below code the output is 0, error, 1,error, 2. There is while loop which iterates till the condition within
#the if statement is met which is when i becomes 3, break the loop. Else print error after every iterated i+=1
#i = 0
#while i < 5:
#    print(i)
#    i += 1
#    if i == 3:
#        break
#    else:
#        print("error")


# output is from 0 to 4. Once count becomes equal to 1 loop breaks.
#count = 0
#while True:
#    print(count)
#    count += 1
#    if count >= 5:
#        break
